## Fictitious Company

**"NovaMart" is a completely fictitious company name.** It was created solely for the purposes of this educational demonstration project. NovaMart does not represent, refer to, imply, or have any affiliation with any real company, organization, brand, or entity — past, present, or future. Any resemblance to an actual company name, trademark, or business is purely coincidental and entirely unintentional.

## Educational & Experimentation Use Only

This entire repository — including all source code, data, documentation, configuration files, architecture diagrams, and related materials — is provided **strictly for educational and experimentation purposes only**.

**This code must not be deployed to any production environment.** By no stretch of imagination should any component of this project be used in a live, production, or customer-facing system. Specifically:

- The code has **not been security-audited** and may contain vulnerabilities
- The code has **not been performance-tested** at scale
- The code makes **no guarantees** of correctness, reliability, availability, or fitness for any commercial purpose
- Error handling is simplified for demonstration clarity
- Authentication and authorization patterns are illustrative, not production-grade

## Third-Party Services

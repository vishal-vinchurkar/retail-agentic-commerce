## DESIGN DECISIONS (LOCKED)

- **Theme:** Snowflake blue (#29B5E8) ONLY accent color. No orange, amber, green, or purple for accents.
- **Background:** Dark gradient (#070a12 to #0c1225)
- **Navigation:** Left/right arrow buttons (session state), no radio buttons
- **Progress:** 3px blue gradient bar at top + "X / Y" counter at bottom
- **Animation:** fadeInUp 0.5s on slide content
- **Text sizes:** Titles 3rem, subtitles 1.15rem, card titles 1.05-1.15rem, card body 0.95-1rem
- **No scrolling:** Content fits viewport on every slide
- **No watermark:** Snowflake SVG watermark removed
- **No "Powered by" footer:** Removed from architecture diagram
- **Emdash:** Never used anywhere (looks AI-written)
- **Never say "database":** Use "platform" when referring to Snowflake

## SNOWFLAKE SERVICES GROUPING (LOCKED)

**Snowflake Native (blue, left side of architecture):**
- Cortex Search (Semantic) - REAL: SEARCH_PREVIEW() calls
- Cortex Complete (LLM) - REAL: COMPLETE() calls
- Cortex Analyst (Text-to-SQL) - REAL: REST API calls
- Streamlit (Experience) - REAL: entire app built in it

**Industry Protocols (muted, right side of architecture):**
- UCP (Commerce) - CONCEPTUAL: architectural pattern
- A2A (Agent) - CONCEPTUAL: architectural pattern
- MCP (Context) - CONCEPTUAL: architectural pattern, NOT implemented as MCP server
- AP2 (Payment) - CONCEPTUAL: architectural pattern
- ACP (Txn) - CONCEPTUAL: architectural pattern

---

## WHAT'S REAL vs CONCEPTUAL IN THE DEMO

### Genuinely implemented:
- Cortex Search: `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SEARCH_PREVIEW()` calls against vector embeddings
- Cortex Complete: `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE()` calls for LLM reasoning/recommendations
- Cortex Analyst: REST API calls to `/api/v2/cortex/analyst/message` with semantic model
- Snowflake data: NOVAMART_RETAIL database with PRODUCT_360, CUSTOMER_360, SUPPLY_CHAIN schemas
- Customer lookup: Real SQL query to CUSTOMER_360.CUSTOMERS table
- Inventory lookup: Real SQL query to SUPPLY_CHAIN.INVENTORY across 5 DCs
- Streamlit frontend: Entire UI built in Streamlit
- NovaMart is fictitious (stated in DISCLAIMER.md), all data is synthetic

### Conceptual/simulated:
- 7 agents execute SEQUENTIALLY in app flow, not as independent autonomous services
- Agent insights generated by `generate_agent_insights()` - deterministic based on data
- Industry protocols (UCP, A2A, MCP, AP2, ACP) are architectural patterns, not implementations
- Auto-PO is a triggered event in app logic, not a real purchase order to a supplier
- Dynamic pricing applies loyalty-tier discounts, not real-time market-driven pricing
- Distribution centres (SYD, MEL, BNE, PER, ADL) are mapped in code, inventory queries are real

---

## THINGS NEVER TO CLAIM

1. Agents run autonomously in parallel (they orchestrate sequentially)
2. MCP is implemented (it's an industry protocol pattern)
3. UCP/A2A/AP2/ACP are implemented (architectural patterns)
4. Auto-PO sends real purchase orders (it's an app event)
5. Dynamic pricing is market-driven (it's tier-based)
6. This is production-ready (it's a demo/showcase)
7. Specific ROI numbers (no production data to back them up)
8. Snowflake is a "database" (use "platform")

## SLIDE 4 DIFFERENTIATORS (LOCKED TEXT)

| Left Column | Right Column |
|------------|-------------|
| **Zero Data Movement** - AI runs where the data already lives. No ETL pipelines to separate ML platforms. No copies. No security trade-offs. | **Streamlit: AI to Experience** - From Cortex output to production app on the same platform. This was built by one SE - no front-end team. |
| **Snowflake Intelligence + Cortex Code** - Executive insights and developer acceleration, natively integrated. From idea to production on a single platform. | **Single Platform Economics** - Pay-per-query. No GPU clusters to manage. No model hosting fees. Consumption-based. |
| **Native Governance** - Every agent decision fully auditable. Column-level security, dynamic data masking, and role-based access - all built in. | **Data Already Here** - Product 360, Customer 360, Supply Chain already in Snowflake. Activation cost is near zero. |

## SLIDE 5 DEMO CALLOUT

- Background: NovaMart coral gradient (`#E85A4F`)
- Title: "NovaMart: Agentic Retail Intelligence"
- Subtitle: "End-to-end autonomous commerce - from natural language intent to order fulfilment and supplier PO"
- No timing info, no pacing guide - just a clean transition slide

---

## SLIDE 7 POC FRAMING (LOCKED)

- Title: "Ready to Start"
- No specific timeline (no "4-week POC")
- "Scoped POC on a single category and segment using Cortex Search + Complete"
- "Consumption-based, no upfront cost"
- "We can be in production faster than you'd expect"
